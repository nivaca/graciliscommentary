            This is the tenth distinction which is continued to the preceding thus
            because after the

            now

            he begins to treat about the procession of the Holy Spirit. 
            And he divides this in tow parts 
            because in the first place he determines 
            about its mode of procession, 
            in the second place about its productive principle. 
            The second begins in the beginning of the distinction 11,

            Distinction 11 follows

            about which <!-- translation of quae quid unclear --> 
            distinction 11 is divided into two parts.

            the agreement of the Latins, 
            in the second place he shows the disagreement of the Greeks.

              That not 
              because then it follows in the first place that 
              it is only repugnant that the Holy Spirit is not produced by the Son 
              just as it is not distinguished from it.
              The consequent is false 
              because if, through the impossible, 
              the Son were not to produce the Holy Spirit, 
              this distinction between them would still exist, 
              therefore. 
              The first consequence is proved because, 
              if in the same mode, the Father and Son spirate,
              then therefore the Father spirates in such a way that, 
              if he were not to spirate the Holy Spirit, 
              it would not be said to be from him. 
              It follows that, if the Son also does not spirate, 
              then it would also be distinguished.

              In the second place, 
              that the Son does not spirate the Holy Spirit 
              is proved by the authority of
              <ref xml:id="pg-b1q11-Rd1e251" corresp="#pg-b1q11-Qd1e258">
                <name ref="#JohnDamascenus">Damascene</name>, in book one, chapters 10 and 11</ref>,

              Therefore, if it is not from the Son, 
              it does not seem to precede from him.

              In the third place, 
              if this is true, 
              it would follow that it would naturally proceed from them.
              The consequent is false because 
              it proceeds in the mode of love and of liberty or of the will.
              But the consequence is proved 
              because internally there is a single mode of proceeding in the divine 
              that cannot be made into a plurality 
              as was said above. 
              But the Son proceeds from the Father in a natural mode or naturally, 
              therefore, if the Holy Spirit proceeds from something,
              this will be naturally and not freely.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e244">
              First conclusion: though the Holy Spirit 
              does not proceed from the Father prior or more greatly than from the Son, 
              nevertheless that the Spirit is or proceeds from something  
              is only able to be shown by means of faith.
              The first part is proved 
              because for each sign the Holy Spirit is spirated from the Son, 
              but for every sign for which it is spirated it is from the Father, 
              therefore for any sign spirated by the Father 
              for the same sign it is spirated by thed Son.
              The major premise is clear because,
              if the opposite were given,
              it follows that in some sign 
              the Holy Spirit would from one only 
              and not from two, 
              contradicting the faith.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e265">
              <!-- review paragraph break here -->
              In the second place, namely, the minor is proved 
              because for each for which there is active spiration, 
              there is also passive spiration, 
              therefore.
              The antecedent is proved 
              because otherwise it would follow 
              that the Father some sign would spirate the Holy Spirit
              for which sign the Holy Spirit would not be spirated, 
              which is a contradiction.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e288">
              <!-- review paragraph break -->
              The second part of the conclusion is proved 
              because it would follow 
              that the Trinity of the divine persons 
              would be able to be shown by evident reason, 
              which is false as has been proven.

              Again, 
              every argument short of faith 
              proving that the Holy Spirit proceeds would prove 
              that the Holy Spirit produces another Holy Spirit, 
              just as was said about the generation of the Son. <!-- cross reference here ?? -->

              The first corollary: 
              just as the Father does not speak
              <pb ed="#L" n="39-v"/>
              the Word earlier than he spirates the Holy Spirit, 
              so the generation of the Divine Word is not really prior 
              to the spiration of the Holy Spirit. 
              The first is clear because 
              the Son is not prior to the Holy Spirit, 
              therefore.
              The antecedent is proved 
              because, 
              just as it is proved that 
              the Father is not prior to the Son, 
              so it is proved that the Son 
              is not prior to the Holy Spirit.
              The second part is proved 
              because in the divine 
              there is no real priority in anything, 
              as it has been proved.
              Likewise if generation preceded spiration, 
              it would follow that 
              what is generated would precede what is spirated, 
              which has been disproved.

              The second corollary:

              its express image and perfect likeness.
              This is clear because by the same reason
              it would be proved that the Holy Spirit produces the Son, 
              therefore.

            Haec distinctio continet 
            <unclear>quattuor</unclear> conclusiones. 
            Prima est 
            quod Spiritus Sanctus est amore seu caritas sive dilectio Patris et Filii qua Pater et Filius se 
            invicem diligunt et nos.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e1590">
            Secunda conclusio quod caritas aliquando refertur ad substantiam quae communis est 
            tribus personis et tota in simul[?] aliquando specialiter ad personam Spiritus Sancti sicut sapientia divina 
            aliquando pro substantia divina sumitur aliquando pro Filio capitur.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e1598">
            Tertia conclusio sicut Spiritus Sanctus in Trinitate 
            specialiter dicitur caritas quae est Patris et Filii unio ita et nomen tenet proprie quod Patri 
            et Filio quodammodo communiter congruitur.

            etc. 
            Haec distinctio 11 continet 
            conclusiones quattuor. Prima quod Spiritus Sanctus procedit a Patre et Filio secundum doctores Latinos 
            et secundum veritatem quod probatur per multa doctorum testimonia et Scripturae Sacrae.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e1617">
            Secunda conclusio: 
            licet Graeci confiteantur et concedant Spiritum Sanctum esse spiritum Filii, tamen dicunt Spiritum Sanctum 
            tantum a Patre procedere et non a Filio.

            Quarta conclusio: Graeci concedentes Spiritum Sanctum esse spiritum Filii convenit[?] 
            nobiscum in fide sententiam eandem quia non est aliud esse spiritum Patris vel Filii quam 
            esse vel procedere a Patre et Filio.
