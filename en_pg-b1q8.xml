            This is distinction 7 of the first book 
            which continues with respect to the preceding 
            because after the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> determined about divine generation 
            with respect to mode and form,
            he begins here to determine about those thing that have to do with the power of acting. 
            And he divides this into two 
            because in the first place he inquires whether 
            the power of generating belongs to Father eternally,
            secondly whether this power is found in the Son.

              That not, 
              no suppositable ratio speaks a perfection, 
              therefore there is not an active generation. 
              The consequence holds because active generatio  
              is a suppositable ratio of the Father.
              The antecedent is clear because then 
              in the divine there would be another goodness 
              besides the essential goodness.
              Likewise because to not produce, 
              would be to argue an imperfection, 
              and thus neither the divine essence 
              nor the Holy Spirit would be essentially perfect.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q8-d1e146">
              In the second place, 
              it would follows that every divine person would not be as perfect as the essence. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because any person lacks some supposibile ratio becase 
              the Father does not have the suppositable ratio of the Son, 
              nor of the Holy Spirit, 
              nor of the converse.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q8-d1e152">
              In the third place, 
              it would follow that the theologian evidently 
              would be able to prove that there is generation in the divine. 
              The consequent is false. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because it is evidently able to be deduced 
              that whatever God is,
              he is everything that it is better to be than not to be absolutely,

            <p xml:id="pgb1q8-d1e173">
              First conclusion: 
              though from the Son and the Holy Spirit no divine word is able to be generated, 
              nevertheless something is producible through the speaking of the Son or the Holy Spirit.
              The first is clear 
              because otherwise there would be many possible words in the divine, 
              indeed de facto this should be put against faith. 
              The second part is proved 
              because through the speaking of the whole Trinity 
              all created things are produced and producibile things 
              are able to be produced. 
              This is clear through that <title ref="#ps">Psalm</title> 
              <cit>
                <quote xml:id="pg-b1q8-Qd1e3633" ana="#ps32_9"><!-- et ps148_5 -->he spoke and things were made</quote>

            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q8-d1e196">
              First corollary: that not every speaking with the word speaks the word, 
              though perhaps the converse is true. 
              This is clear 
              because speaking the divine word is precisely and properly to the Father, 
              but speaking with the word suits three, 
              as is clear through the conclusion. 
              From which it seems to follow that, 
              though every internal speaking is understanding, 
              nevertheless not every understanding is speaking.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q8-d1e211">
              The second corollary: 
              the eternal productive power of the Word is 
              not a pure relation or merely something related.
              This is clear because a relation is not a ratio of the Father's being absolutely, 
              therefore it is not a ratio of acting. 
              From which it seems to follow that 
              just as the essence is the ratio of the Father's being, 
              so also it seems to be the ratio of producing the Word. 
              From which it follows further 
              that power of generating the divine word 
              speaks something absolute with respespec to what is principally signified, 
              though he knows with respect to what is begotten.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q8-d1e238">
              The third corollary: 
              though the word has being and act from the Father, 
              nevertheless the Father and Son produce equally freely. 
              This is clear because 
              the Son is not determined by the Father with some natural necessity, 
              therefore they produce the Holy Spirit equally freely, 
              just as the Father himself generates the word. 
              The antecedent is clear from what has been said above. 
              Further it follows that it is as repugnant to the Word to intrinsecally depend 
              as it is necessarily repugnant to it that the Father demanded or needed. <!-- translation help --> 
              
              This is clear because all things convey an imperfection.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q8-d1e284">
              Third conclusion: 
              that though it is not a kind of perfection in generation 
              that something is produced through it from non being to being, 
              nevertheless that something is able to generate, 
              because that being is not evidently probable, 
              is absolutely a kind of immense perfection. 
              The first part is clear because, 
              if this were so, 
              it would follow that divine generation would lack some perfection absolutely. 
              The consequent is false. 
              The consequence is clear because the Son 
              neither through generation nor through some other 
              is produced from non being to being. 
              The second part is proved because, 
              if this were so, 
              it would follow that the that <mentioned>God is three</mentioned> 
              would be efficaciously demonstrable and would be evidently proved. 
              The consequent was disproved earlier. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because the duality of the persons 
              and the trinity of them would be proved in the same way. 
              The third part is proved 
              because it would be able to produce a finite word 
              and would be a perfection of a created memory. 
              Therefore the power to produce the uncreated will be an immense perfection of uncreated memory.  
              This is confirmed because the understanding
              <pb ed="#L" n="31-r"/>
              of the father is an immense perfection, therefore. 
              The consequence is clear because 
              to speak of the Father is to speak formally his understanding, 
              and consequently it is a vital act 
              and a kind of immense perfection.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q8-d1e321">
              First corollary: it is not of lesser perfection to speak the notional aspect of the Father 
              as it is to understand his intrinsic and essential aspect. 
              This is proved because 
              each is of immense perfection, 
              as is clear through the conclusion.
            </p>
            
            <p xml:id="pgb1q8-d1e335">
              The second corollary: 
              as he is able formally to be blessed in his notional utterance 
              so he is able to be beatified in his essential understanding. 
              This is clear because the Father is beatified formally 
              in his every immense perfection. 
              And these are two corollaries against the position 
              of  
              <ref>
                <name ref="#Scotus">Scotus</name>, in distinction 6 of the first book

            <p xml:id="pgb1q8-d1e354">
              Third corollary: 
              no reason separated from faith and clear vision 
              certifies why the Father in the divine does not produce or generate 
              many words or many sons. I mean this according to the common law.
              This is clear because it is believed by faith alone 
              that only one person in the divine is able to be generated. 
              This is confirmed because every potency and perfect which the Father has, the Son and Holy Spirit have, 
              there by this reason it is not able to be convincingly concluded that he would not be able to produce many sons.
              This is clear from what has been said.
              From this the responsive corollary is clear that,
              though the generation of the eternal word is absolutely immense perfection, 
              nevertheless the negation of it not in one either is the privation of perfection or not, 
              nevertheless the negation of it in one is the privation of perfection.

            Haec distinctio continet quattuor conclusiones.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q8-d1e1155">
            Prima: quod Patrem generare Filium non est aliquid subiectum potentiae 
            divinae autem vocati est, tamen aliqua potentia vel voluntas, nec tamen sequitur personam quae hoc potest 
            vel vult potentiorem esse persona quae <unclear>hoc</unclear> non potest vel vult
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q8-d1e1175">
            Secunda conclusio: quod, 
            licet Filius non possit generare, hoc tamen non est ex impotentia sed ex proprietate quia non 
            oportet eum generare aliter qua ratione Filius generasset nepotem ferri nepos generasset 
            <sic>pro nepotem</sic>, et sic sine statu. Filius ergo non potest esse Pater nec sui nec 
            alterius nec hoc provenit ex impotentia, sed ex proprietate generationis qua sic est Filius quod 
            non potest esse Pater.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q8-d1e1193">
            Tertia conclusio: quod Pater est potens natura sine essentia Filium gignere 
            et eadem potentia est in Filio qua potuit gigni et in Patre qua potuit generare.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q8-d1e1199">
            Quarta conclusio: licet sit eadem potentia qua Pater potest gignere et Filius gigni, tamen est alia proprietas 
            seu notio qua Pater est genitor et alia qua Filius est genitus ita quod referendo 
            posse generare et posse generari ad proprietatem, tunc Pater habet aliquod posset quod 
            non habet Filius et econverso. Et illud posse est notionale et relativi quia non dicit quid sed

            bene non sequitur Pater habet potentiam generandi et Filius non ergo aliquam potentiam vel aliquod 
            posset habet Pater quod non habet Filius sed eadem potentia Pater generat qua Filius generatur 
            quia Pater potest generare et Filius generari sicut etiam non sequitur Pater habet potentiam quod sit Pater 
            et hanc non habet Filius, ergo aliquam potentiam habet Pater quam non habet Filius.</p>
