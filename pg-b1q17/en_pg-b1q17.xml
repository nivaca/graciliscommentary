            This is the second principal part of distinction 17
            which thus continues the first part 
            because 
            after the 
            <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name>
            posited his intention about the love of God and neighbor, 
            now he shows how it [charity] receives

            And this part 
            is divided into three 
            because 
            in the first place the

            regarding this introduces the critical question, 
            in the second place hi posits the proper response,

            Whether through 
            the greater virtual perfection of moral goodness 
            in the pilgrim 
            we are able to conclude that there is a gradual intension 
            of created charity in that same pilgrim?

              That not 
              because any doing well of a just pilgrim 
              is to act well immeasurably with respect 
              to the species of moral goodness and virtue, 
              therefore no such thing is intended,
              and as a consequence 
              neither is charity.
              The consequence is clear 
              because to the unmeasured 
              something greater is not able to be given.
              The antecedent is proved 
              because to do something meritorious 
              proceeds from the formal power of the Holy Spirit, 
              consequently such an act is an inmeasurable good 
              with respect to the species of moral virtue and moral goodness. 
              This is the argument of

              In the second place, 
              if charity were able to be intended gradually, 
              it would follow that 
              that would also be able to remitted gradually. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because just as through the replication of degrees there is a gradual intension, 
              so through the remission of those degrees 
              there is a remission of them. 
              But the falsity of the consequent 
              is proved 
              because this remission occurs 
              either through a mortal or a venial sin. 
              Not the latter 
              because this corrupts the entire charity, 
              and not the second 
              because then the venial sin 
              would punish with an eternal penalty by its own proper ratio, 
              which is against the

              if charity 
              were intended gradually, 
              then either acquired charity 
              would be the same with the first or different. 
              If the latter, 
              then it follows that 
              the same thing increases and produces itself. 
              If the second, 
              it follows that two habits 
              distinct only in number 
              would be in the same soul, 
              and thus there would be 
              as many loves in man 
              as a man has degrees of love, 
              which does not seem like it should be said. 
              This is confirmed 
              because either this degree would 
              essential to the quality of charity preexisting in goodness <!-- needs transcription and translation review here --> 
              or it would be accidental.
              If the first, 
              then this first form would be prior to the species of the other
              because charity is in some essential part. 
              If the second, 
              it follows 
              that it does not make one thing in itself 
              with the charity preceding it, 
              and thus it does not increase it.

              In opposition, 
              it is argued that 
              the moral goodness of any pilgrim 
              argues from the common law for some degree of charity in the same thing, 
              therefore the greater goodness would argue for greater charity.
              But now some pilgrim is 
              more perfect and morally better than before, 
              therefore someone now has more 
              charity than before, 
              and this cannot be unless through the gradual intention of charity, 
              therefore the question is true.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q17-d1e239">
              First conclusion: 
              though the Holy Spirit is not able 
              to form and actuate the created mind immeasurably, 
              nevertheless the Holy 
              <pb ed="#L" n="55-v"/>
              Spirit is the activating formal power and salvation of the just mind.
              The first part is clear 
              because it is repugnant for the finite and measured 
              to be actuated and formed immeasurably 
              in its own acting.
              The second part is proved through 
              <ref xml:id="pg-b1q17-Rd1e274">

              And these words are used in this distinction 
              where it is said that 
              without the Holy Spirit 
              we are not able to love Christ 
              and we are not able to keep his commandments 
              and the less we perceive it 
              to the same degree that power is not able to reach us.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q17-d1e277">
              First corollary: 
              the formal actuative power of the Holy Spirit is as intensely in the mind 
              as it intrinsically gives pleasing or charitable being to it.
              The conclusion and corollary 
              are against  
              <cit>
                <ref xml:id="pg-b1q17-Rd1e310">

              where he asks whether 
              naturally good things are able to be 
              rationally proportioned or compared 
              to gratuitiously good things.
              The corollary is clear 
              because according to 
              <ref xml:id="pg-b1q17-Rd1e322">
                <name ref="#Augustine">Augustine</name>

              </ref> 
              the less we perceive the Holy Spirit in us 
              the less we are able to love Christ, 
              and the more we perceive it the 
              more we love, 
              therefore

              The second corollary: 
              any action proceeding 
              from the formal power of 
              uncreated charity 
              is a finite act with respect to the degree 
              and species of virtue and moral goodness. 
              This is clear because 
              then the Holy Spirit would not be 
              power in the mind according to greater and lesser degrees,

              Third corollary:

              from the formal power of uncreated charity 
              with respect species in the being of the mind 
              is infinitely meritorious or attributable to the will. 
              This is clear because otherwise 
              all meritorious works would be of the same species, 
              which is false. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because all things proceed

              The second conclusion: 
              though no grade of charity 
              is removed from some evil or guilt, 
              nevertheless any created charity 
              is an intensibile and remissible form.
              The first part is proved because 
              guild does not diminish charity 
              according to the second introduced against the opposition.
              The second part is proved 
              because any created charity 
              is divisible in degrees,
              therefore it is intensible and remissible 
              through some power.
              The antecedent is clear 
              because neither a maximum nor minimum 
              degree of charity should be given.
              And the consequence is clear 
              since God is able at once and successively 
              to produce or corrupt 
              any form having and intensive latitude.
              But it is not the case for us that 
              God produces it in the soul 
              whether at once or successively,

              The corollary is proved 
              because just as 
              intension is in a corporeal quality, 
              so fervor is in charity.
              But the intension of a quality 
              is not distinguished from the quality, 
              though through a comparison of the extremes 
              it is in some way varied, 
              therefore neither is the fervor 
              of charity distinguished from charity itself. 
              But according to the conclusion 
              no degree of charity is diminished through a venial sin, 
              therefore neither is the fervor diminished.

              The corollary is proved

              Third conclusion: without the intension or 
              remission of created charity
              <pb ed="#L" n="56-r"/>
              it stands that the pilgrim is better and more perfect 
              than moral perfection, 
              otherwise the conclusion would be posited 
              that without a new grade or the 
              abjection in the mind of the pilgrim 
              it stands that charity would be intended 
              and the pilgrim would be better now than before.
              The conclusion is proved 
              because the Holy Spirit 
              with any charity is able to incline the mind 
              equally to inhering in God with love more firmly 
              and for doing well meritoriously, 
              therefore. 
              The antecedent is clear 
              because it is just as easy 
              for the Holy Spirit to concur and to produce 
              with a weak and diminished second cause 
              as it is with an intensified and great second cause. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because that the mind loves God fervently 
              is improve the pilgrim and for charity to be intensified.

              the essence of love with respect to its essentila grade 
              does not change.
              Nevertheless I do not wish to say that
              the intension of charity thus occurs de facto
              but from the possible.

              The first corollary: 
              with respect to the remission of cupidity 
              the intension of created charity should not be quantified.
              This is clear from the conclusion,

              This is confirmed

              Third responsive corollary:

              or in the will of a just pilgrim, 
              nevertheless without the gradual intension of charity

              now than before from the actuation of immeasurable love

              This is clear because

              it is not as bad to kill a man 
              and to repent as it is to commit a 
              venial sin and not make satisfaction, 
              and nevertheless the first 
              should not fled less than the second, 
              rather more so.

            Haec secunda pars 
            distinctionis 17 continet 3 conclusiones. 
            Prima quam ponit <name ref="#Lombard">Magister</name> quod caritas quae est Spiritus Sanctus 
            in se non proficit nec deficit nec augetur nec minuitur quia immutabilis est 
            in se sed in corde hominis <unclear>gratia descit</unclear>.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q17-d1e1180">
            Secunda conclusio: quod, licet Spiritus Sanctus sit ubique et 
            in omni creatura, tamen non omnis creatura habet ipsum quia aliter bruta et insensibilia ipsum 
            haberent quod non est dicendum.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q17-d1e1188">
            Tertia conclusio: quod Spiritus Sanctus est caritas quae non habenti datur etiam 
            habenti ut plus habeatur et ut in ipse augeatur et proficiat, et hoc est quando homo in caritate 
            proficit et in merito, et haec sufficiant pro praesenti lectione, sequitur tertia pars huius distinctionis 17.
