            This is distinction 36, 
            which relates to the preceding in the following way, 
            for after the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name>
            treated about the knowledge of God 
            according to himself and absolutely, 
            now begins to treat about it through 
            its relation to what is known and comparatively.
            And this is divided into three parts, 
            for first he introduces a two fold question 
            with solutions, 
            in the second place he offers a declaration of his response, 
            in the third place what has been said 
            he makes a summary.

              The consequence is held 
              because whatever God knows, 
              he knows this through a proper representing idea.

              In the second place,

              The consequence is clear 
              because the divine word 
              is not able to reveal anything unknown to itself.
              The antecedent is clear

              shares in this, <!-- translation review needed -->
              and as a consequence 
              it is ideated in God. 
              The consequences are valid,

              The second part is proved

              had a distinct being, 
              it would follows that creatures 
              would have had some being distinct from God 
              before their creation.
              The consequent is false, 
              therefore. 
              This is confirmed 
              because it would follows 
              that in the divine 
              there would be a formal or essential distinction.
              I prove 
              because created things, 
              as they are contained in God, 
              would be distinct from him

              First corollary: 
              just as in the divine essence 
              there is a single virtual ratio of continence, 
              so in the divine science there is a single ideal ratio of relucence. 
              This is clear 
              because God knows all things through one thing 
              inasmuch as he has the power of many, 
              ergo. 
              The antecedent is clear 
              because God knows, contains, and represents 
              through the same thing because 
              in God the ratio of knowing creatures 
              is formally neither more nor less 
              than the ratio of containing them virtually.
              And the antecedent is proved 
              because however much identity and unity is in 
              the act of understanding 
              there is as much unity in the principle 
              and in the ratio of understanding.
              But in the divine act of understanding 
              there is formal unity, 
              therefore.
              The proof of the minor: 
              because in one act,
              formally indistinct, 
              he understands all things distinctly, 
              otherwise he would not have a singular word.

              The second part is proved
              because a limited representative 
              is able to represent 
              some object distinctly, 
              therefore the divine essence 
              which contains the representive thing eminently
              is able to represent the object equally distinctly, 
              just as if it were not representative of another.
              The consequence holds 
              because it is immeasurable and immeasurably representative,
              virtually equivalent to the limited representatives, 
              therefore.

              The second corollary: 
              if, through the impossible, 
              the divine intellect were to be separated from the supreme essence, 
              then the divine intellect itself would not be the exemplar or idea of things.
              This is clear 
              because just as the ratio of the idea 
              consists in the divine intellect 
              formatively or formally and as an examplar, 
              so also the ratio of the idea consists 
              in the divine essence subjectively or fundamentally and objectively.

              Third corollary: 
              just as any created thing is more perfectly contained in God
              than in its own genus,
              so any such thing 
              more truly and clearly 
              shines in the divine art 
              than in the being of its own species or genus.
              The first part is clear 
              because in its own nature it has a 
              limited, finite, and dependent being,
              but in God absolutely it is independent and unlimited.
              The second part is clear from the same fundamental reason 
              because things shines in the same way that they having being.
              And this is confirmed 
              because no created thing is 
              able to impress a representation of itself so perfect 
              that the divine ideal cognitive ratio 
              does not represent it infinitely more perfect.
              Again in the second place 
              because created likeness is a false copy of a created thing <!-- translation check esp "false copy" -->
              and diminished not being adequate to the being of the thing.
              But the idea is a perfect and certain likeness of anything.
              In the third place
              because before this was produced 
              it would be able to be to known
              through this idea,
              and not in its own genus or species,
              when its is and how it is and its every manner of being. <!--transl. check -->

              From what has been said
              it follows that, 
              just as in the divine essence 
              the containing ratio of things is orderable 
              according to before and after, 
              so in the divine science 
              the ideal ratio is not intrinsically able to be plurified. 
              This is clear because 
              were plurality to be posited, 
              then it would follows that 
              there would be in God 
              many ratios or many principles of understanding and acting.
              The consequent is false 
              because, 
              just as there is a single act, 
              so there is a single ratio, 
              as has been proven 
              since the idea is the principle or ratio of knowing.

              This is proved 
              because the idea is an exemplar 
              according to which something is producible,

              The second is clear 
              because a privation is known through what is had. 
              Item, 
              a person knowing that they do not have a florin
              turns their imagination to the likeness of a florin, 
              whence no one would know that they lack a forin 
              unless they had knowledge of a florin 
              either in itself or in a representing likeness.

              Third corollary: 
              though God knows guilt 
              with the knowledge of simple intelligence or vision,
              nevertheless he does not know the evil of guilt 
              with the knowledge of it being accepted or approval.
              The first part is clear 
              because God with the knowledge of simple intelligence 
              knows both possible and impossible good and bad things, 
              but with the knowledge of vision only past, present, and future things.
              The second part is proved 
              because with the knowledge of approval 
              he know only good things and the evils of guilt, 
              otherwise God would be the cause of guilt, 
              since whatever he seems to will positively
              he is approvingly disposed.  <!-- translation check, sort of elided over of "respect cuius" for simplicity -->
