            about the generation of the Son and the procession of the Holy Spirit, 
            now he treats about each of them individually by comparison,

            in the second place

            it is neither unbegotten or begotten, 
            whether the Holy Spirit is produced

              the pilgrim theologian would be able to know

              In the second place, 
              the internal productions of the divine are of the same reasons and species, 
              therefore just as the Son through one is said to be begotten, 
              so the Holy Spirit for a similarity in species 
              is able to be called begotten. 
              The consequence is clear because 
              specific identity of production and of producing and the produced terms 
              argue sufficiently for the identity of the denomination or of the natural properties, 
              otherwise it would be the case that 
              the production of <name ref="#Sortes">Socrates</name> and <name ref="#Plato">Plato</name> 
              would be of the same species, 
              and nevertheless one would be of the same species and the other would not.
              The antecedent is first proved 
              because the terms or persons produced through these productions do not differ in species, 
              but only numerically or personally.

              The first conclusion: 
              though it is impossible that 
              the production of the Son 
              is not distinguished from the production of the Holy Spirit, 
              nevertheless from the common law in the present life 
              no one is able to know this distinction with evident reason.
              The first is proved 
              because otherwise it would be possible that 
              there is in the divine 
              which now de facto is, 
              if these productions were not distinguished. 
              But this is impossible, 
              therefore.
              The impossibility is clear 
              through what is said above
              because in whatever way the divine is internally,
              it is necessarily that way.

              The first corollary: in which
              <pb ed="#L" n="43-r"/> 
              it does not follow evidently that the 
              the Son is produced only by the Father 
              and that the Holy Spirit is produced by both, 
              therefore the generation of the Son 
              is distinguished from the procession of the Holy Spirit.
              This is clear because the unity or plurality of the one's producing 
              does not imply the plurality or distinction of the productions, 
              most especially where there is one mode of acting, 
              as is the case in what has been proposed,

              Second conclusion: 
              a specific distinction between the divine persons is as repugnant 
              as the same distinction between eternal productions. 
              This is proved 
              because it is repugnant in both cases, 
              therefore it is equally repugnant.
              The consequences is clear 
              because the repugnance or the opposition of a contradiction 
              does not have latitude nor can it be more or less when taken in the same way. 
              The antecedent is proved 
              because every specific distinction 
              argues and implies diversity of nature.
              But such diversity is repugnant to the divine essence, 
              therefore a specific distinction 
              in the divine persons or productions should not be asserted. 
              The second part is proved 
              because productions are not distinct 
              unless by reason of a distinction of the persons 
              or because it terminates in distinct persons. 
              But the persons are not distinguished in species 
              but only in number, therefore.
              In the second place, 
              the conclusion is proved 
              because the divine supposites are absolutely of the same perfection, 
              therefore they are of the same species. 
              The consequence holds 
              because, just as no two species are of the same perfection, 
              so etc.

            Haec distinctio continet tres conclusiones. Prima: quod cum quaeritur utrum Spiritus Sanctus prius procedat a 
            Patre quam a Filio, dicendum est quod qui potest intelligere generationem Filii de Patre sine tempore 
            etiam sine tempore processionem Spiritus Sancti ab utroque a Patre et Filio intelligat quia in Trinitate 
            nihil prius aut posterius quia ibi ex tempore nihil inchoatur.

          <p xml:id="pgb1q12-d1e1155">Secunda conclusio: quod sicut Spiritus Sanctus 
            non processit ante a Patre quam a Filio, ita non magis vel amplius vel plenius 
            procedit a Patre quam a Filio.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q12-d1e1163">
            Tertia conclusio: quod cum <name ref="#Augustine">Augustinus</name> dicit Spiritum Sanctum procedere

            Haec 13 distinctio continet <!-- 7 --><c>a</c> conclusiones. Prima quod licet Spiritus Sanctus procedat a Patre et sit de substantia Patris sicut et Filius, non tamen dicitur 
            natus sive genitus, et ideo non dicitur Filius cuius ratio est quia si diceretur Filius esset Filius 
            Patris et Filii cum procedat ab utroque, sed absurdum est quod sit Filius amborum quia nullus 
            est filius duorum nisi sit patris et matris.

            Secunda conclusio: quod licet Filius et Spiritus Sanctus procedant 
            a patre tamen dissimiliter quia Spiritus Sanctus procedit a Patre quomodo datus sive ut 
            donum Filius vero procedit ut

            Tertia conclusio: quod Spiritus Sanctus non dicitur Filius quia non est genitus sicut unigenitus nec factus 
            ut per Dei gratiam in adoptionem nasceretur sicut et nos et sic diceretur Filius dei per adoptionem.

            Quarta conclusio: quod non esse quod procedit nascitur quamvis omne quod nascitur procedat.

            quod inter verbi generationem et Spiritus Sancti processionem distinguere[?] non sufficimus in hac vita 
            et ideo sufficiat cuilibet scire quod Filius non est a se ipso sed a Patre nec Spiritus Sanctus a se 
            ipso sed procedit ab utroque.

            nec ingenitus quia si genitus esset duo filii in divinis, si autem ingenitus duos patres 
            ibi affirmaremus quod est inconveniens. Patet quia esse ingenitum proprie convenit Patri.

            Septima conclusio: 
            quod secundum <name ref="#Jerome">Ieromium</name> Spiritus Sanctus dicitur ingenitus, sed <name ref="#Jerome">Ieromus</name> accipit ingenitum pro non genito et sic 
            potest concedi quod Spiritus Sanctus est ingenitus, id est non genitus. <name ref="#Augustine">Augustinus</name> vero accipit ingenitum quam 
            illo qui ab alio non est aliquo, tamen alius est et sic accipiendo ingenitum de solo Patre dicitur 
            quia Filius est ab alio et Spiritus Sanctus a Patre et Filio qui sunt aliae personae. Et sic <name ref="#Lombard">Magister</name> concordat
