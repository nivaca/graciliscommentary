              Not the first

              Second conclusion: 
              the divine Word is a singular term of paternal intellection, 
              emanating from the one understanding 
              by an act that remains internal and of another and declarative of itself.
              This conclusion is clear 
              because, 
              if it were not singular, 
              it follows in the first place that paternal understanding would not have understood itself,
              which is false. 
              In the second place, 
              it follows that such a term would not have been produced from the full fecundity of understanding

              and this beginning is said to be

              a beginning is admitted within the divine, 
              and the name with respect to the same thing is excluded. 
              The first part is clear

              nevertheless he is able to begin something. 
              The first part is clear 
              because whatever is an external creatable thing 
              is producible by the three divine supposites.
