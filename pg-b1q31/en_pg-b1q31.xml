            here he shows that the knowledge of God

            does not receive variety.
            And it is divided in three

            in the second place he adds a response, 
            and the third place his posits an objection.

              That not because 
              no foreknowledge should be put in God, 
              therefore.
              The antecedent is proved 
              then of the object of this foreknowledge 
              is either true or false. 
              It is not true 
              because every true things is present,

              Nor is it false 
              because then God would be able to be decieved.
              In the second place,
              because foreknowledge 
              as such does not imply a perfection.
              In the third place, 
              because God is able to be and not be foreknowledge, 
              but however God is able to be he is that way, 
              therefore he is not foreknowledge.

              In the second place principally,

              holds this with him. 
              Then in the second place 
              because everything able to be is, 
              but the future is able to be,
              therefore it is 
              and consequently it is not future but present.
              Then in the third place 
              because 
              some common measuring ratio would correspond 
              to the entire latitude of contingency.
              This consequent is false 
              because since such a ratio is not able to be suitable 
              to a creature, 
              it necessarily suits God,
              which is false 
              because in God there is no intrinsic contingency.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q31-d1e3243">
              In the third place principally, 
              no such ratio corresponds 
              to divine foreknowledge with respect to a future contingent, 
              therefore.
              The antecedent is proved 
              because it is not suitable to him,
              either that he knows <c>a</c> 
              because then it would necessarily suit him, 
              or that he wishes <c>a</c> <!-- translation check "or" here for "nec" --> 
              because then God would be the cause of future sin.
              Then in the second place,
              because the divine effecting does not terminate 
              except into something positive, 
              but the future is not something positive.
              Then in the third place, 
              because then he would cause freely, 
              and then it would be the case 
              that the divine effects no future, 
              which is false 
              because of the parts of the contradiction 
              the other part is necessarily true. <!-- translation check -->

              In opposition, 
              no thing is future from itself 
              nor does something suffice 
              to put itself into being or to produce itself, 
              therefore it requires some productive cause 
              which puts it into being, 
              but not unless there is also <!-- translation check on use of "there is also -->
              God or a passive cause, 
              which is therefore 
              a certain and perfect foreknowledge of all future things.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q31-d1e3286">
              The first conclusion: 
              though the divine essence 
              according to no perfection absolutely as such 
              is necessary actual knowledge or clarity, 
              nevertheless this is 
              with respect to such a thing 
              ratio freely representing 
              and infallible and also 
              and immeasurable certitude. 
              The first is proved 
              because, 
              if this is so, 
              it follows that necessarily 
              that something is true 
              the divine science would known 
              or that it would be able to lack 
              some perfection absolutely
              Each consequent is false. 
              And the consequence is clear 
              because this known thing 
              would occur necessarily.
              The second part is clear through

              First corollary: 
              though every truth is an object of the divine science, 
              nevertheless only a true future as such 
              is the object of foreknowledge. 
              The first is clear because 
              God is the founder and knower of everything.
              The second is clear 
              because foreknowledge 
              is only said with respect to future things. 
              From this it would be able to be inferred 
              that properly speaking about foreknowing 
              God does not know that the antichrist will be. 
              This is clear because 
              that is not future but present 
              if nevertheless this is something. <!-- translation check. Stil unclear about "si tamen" -->
              Nevertheless it should be known that 
              this proposition 
              God foreknows that the antichrist is future 
              and things similar to this are admitted 
              because it is true that God 
              that God knows that the antichrist 
              is not but will be, 
              or according to others 
              God knows this 
              that the antichrist is a thing that will be future.
              Again, 
              it should be known that 
              having supposed that the antichrist is future,
              this will be nothing in reality, 
              yet God still knows this 
              because God knows 
              that two gods are not distinct from him 
              and nevertheless 
              that there are not two Gods is nothing.
              From these things 
              it is clear that the following consequence is not valid, 
              God knows this or this is present, 
              therefore this a real being.

              Second corollary: 
              though God according to no ratio 
              is necessary knowledge of a future contingent, 
              nevertheless God according to his essential ratio

              is perfect knowledge of any possible future being. 
              The second part 
              is proved because 
              that God is foreknowing the future 
              is part of ratio of perfection, <!-- translation check addition of "part of" -->
              therefore it intrinsically belongs to the divine essence.

              The first part is clear 
              it does not follow,
              anything that is able to be future is, 
              the future is able to be,

              But it ought to be said in the minor premise

              which does mean that it is already there.
