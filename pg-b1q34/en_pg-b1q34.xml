              But this is false 
              because then there would be some infinite passive potency

              The consequent is false. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because nothing would be able to resist omnipotence,

              First conclusion:
              though it may be that something is omnipotent 
              and that it does not have in itself every power formally, 
              nevertheless it is necessary 
              that the <unclear>one and only</unclear> first producer of all things 
              has power according to virtue, grade, and vigor. <!-- translation/transcription check -->
              The first part of the conclusion is proved 
              because God is omnipotent 
              and does not have every power in himself formally, 
              therefore the conclusion is true.
              The first part of the antecedent is clear. 
              The second is proved 
              because some powers are called imperfections, 
              therefore they should not be put in God formally 
              but only virtually.
              The antecedent is clear from passive potencies.
              Again 
              the antecedent is proved from the active potencies of creatures 
              which have a joined imperfection and limitation, 
              and consequently ought not to be put in God formally 
              but only virtually, 
              just as the potency of running, eating, speaking, 
              and similar kinds of potencies. 
              But potencies of willing and understanding 
              are in God formally and are God 
              because they are and they refer to a perfection absolutely.

              First corollary: 
              no one explains divine omnipotence 
              well and sufficiently 
              as the power to do whatever does not imply a contradiction. <!-- transl dbheck -->
              This is clear because a sin is doable, 
              and nevertheless God is not able to do it, 
              therefore.

              Second corollary: 
              to the degree that it is necessary that the creature is possible 
              so to the same degree
              it is necessary that the creature is makable by omnipotence.
              This is clear 
              because 
              it follows, 
              no creature is able to be, 
              therefore no power is able to make the creature to be, 
              therefore divine omnipotence 
              is not able to make the creature to be.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q34-d1e3373">
              Third corollary: 
              it is the case that
              something is omnipotent 
              and not be sufficiently powerful for something producible.
              This is clear 
              because if this is not so, 
              then the Son would not be omnipotent

              Second conclusion: 
              though through the infinite immensity

              or is able to be an adequate term to divine omnipotence.
              The first part is proved 
              for it is not the case

              Again, 
              note that part of the ratio of omnipotence
              is that it is free, 
              from which it is clear that 
              to say <mentioned>omnipotence</mentioned> 
              is to say something more than 
              <mentioned>infinite power</mentioned>.
              Whence, 
              if there were an infinite power 
              and it were not free, 
              then this would not be omnipotence.
              The second part of the conclusion 
              is proved because, 
              if thus, 
              it follows that
              when such a thing is produced into existence 
              God would not be able to produce something 
              unless he would destroy that either completely or in part.
              The consequent seems inconvenient.
              The consequences is clear 
              because since this effect would be adequate to divine omnipotence, 
              it would contain every perfection able to be produced.
              Or, 
              if it did not contain every such perfection, 
              it follows that the term would not be adequate to the thing 
              which is opposed to what has been posited, 
              therefore the conclusion is true.
