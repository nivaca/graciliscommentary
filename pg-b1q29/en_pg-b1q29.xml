            treated how things are in the divine science, 
            now he shows how God is in the essence of every creature. 
            And this is divided in three 
            because in the first place regarding the being of God in things 
            he lists some modes and approves of the true modes, 
            in the second place he disproves false modes, 
            in third place he confirms manifest what he says.

            Regarding the first, 
            he does two things
            because in the first place

            The following question is asked,
            whether the divine or necessary principle 
            in every being is a necessary being; <!-- translation check needed --> 
            whether just as God is the true and infallible idea of everything, 
            so also every thing is locus of the capacity of God himself, though changeable?

              That not because 
              it would follow 
              that God would not be able in some situations <!-- trans check "some situations for "aliquo passo situaliter" --> 
              to act at a distance.
              The consequent is false 
              because then an agent acts more quickly 
              on something near at hand 
              than something further removed.
              With the supposed disposition 
              the consequence is clear, 
              if God is everywhere, 
              it follows no thing is locally at a distance from God. 
              This is confirmed 
              because it is the case that God is everywhere
              according to power and not according to essence,
              therefore. <!-- paragraph needs trans review -->

              In the second place, 
              God is able to acquire a certain place, 
              therefore God is not fixed in every place.
              The consequence holds, 
              and the antecedent is clear 
              both because God is able to be in a place 
              or in a creature 
              in which he is not, 
              and also because it is possible 
              that some being is not the locus of God
              because no created being is a necessary being.

              In the third place, 
              God is not present everywhere, 
              therefore. 
              The antecedent is clear 
              in the first place 
              God is able to begin to be anywhere, 
              for having supposed that were to destroy every created place 
              and then afterward were to recreate it, 
              then in this case he would begin to be everywhere. 
              Secondly 
              because is not an inspiration or an empty imagined thing. 
              Thirdly because the God-man is not everywhere, 
              therefore God is not everywhere.
              The consequence holds because every God<supplied>-man</supplied> is man,  
              and the antecedent is proved because God is not everywhere man, 
              otherwise some body would de facto be in an infinity of places.

              The consequence is clear.

              that if the divine power 
              is not apart from any being or place, 
              then it is sufficiently inferred

              given that there are parts of air distant from it

              The second conclusion:

              This is proved because 
              to lack place 
              is the proper disposition or condition of that which has been placed, 
              therefore God is not properly contained in any place

              The consequence holds, 
              and the antecedent is clear. 
              The second part is proved 
              because to be properly contained in space 
              is to be terminated and exceeded by some space.

              so that God moves from place to place, 
              from time to time,

              therefore he is there through his power, 
              but he is not in that same place through his essence. 
              Therefore it is the case

              therefore the divine power is able 
              to produce something distant from itself. 
              The consequence holds

              Against the second conclusion and corollaries, 
              God is able to be in some way 
              in a place he previously was not, 
              and he is able also not to be 
              where he previously was, 
              therefor God is moveable and changeable. 
              The consequence is clear, 
              and the antecedent is proved 
              because, 
              if <c>b</c> should be destroyed, 
              then God is not there any more, <!-- "any more" as translation of amplius seems to be justified by whitaker's words --> 
              and likewise, 
              if a new place should be created, 
              then God will be newly present in that place.
              This is confirmed 
              because, 
              if God now destroyed the highest heaven, 
              God would not be where the highest heaven now is,

              God would be in that same place, 
              and yet he is not currently there, 
              therefore.
              But immediately it would be able to be said here
              that this will not be through a change of God himself,

              Against this, 
              it is argued 
              because to move locally is 
              to be now in some place 
              and earlier be in one place or another. 
              But this body 
              since it was previously nothing,

              This is confirmed because,

              except through body newly created there, 
              it follows that the created body 
              is naturally there before God. 
              The consequent is false 
              because it follows 
              that the body would be able to be created there 
              without God being there 
              because what is naturally prior 
              is able to be without that which is posterior.
              Again
              God is naturally in a place prior to acting there.

              Against the first part of the third conclusion and its corollaries, 
              it is argued, 
              if God is not in empty space outside of heaven 
              and is able to be there without the positioning of a new body, 
              it follows that God is changeable and moveable locally. 
              The consequent is false. 
              The consequence is clear because 
              this kind of transition from not being there to being there 
              is not able to be without change in God or in something else. 
              But the fact tat God is there without a new position etc. 
              is proved because in such an imaginary space 
              God is ale to place an angel with a created body 
              and then is able to annihilate this body 
              while conserving the angel, 
              just as if God were to annihilate 
              the air existing in this house 
              while conserving us here.

              God was present to any imaginable space outside heaven, 
              therefore. 
              The antecedent is proved 
              because 
              that God acts in any created space 
              presupposes that God is there

              therefore he is present in this space. 
              The consequence is clear

              is actually present to God 
              unless it is in potency only,

            prima conclusio distinctionis 37: 
            quod Deus <unclear>incommutabiliter<!-- incommunicabiliter?--></unclear> semper 
            in se existens est in omni natura 
            seu essentia praesentialiter potentialiter 
            et essentialiter sine sui diffinitione, 
            etiam omni loco sine circumscriptione,
            et omni tempore sine mutabilitate, 
            et etiam <unclear>in sanctis<!-- this word has been used several times before --></unclear> <unclear>speritibus[?]</unclear>, 
            et in animalibus habitans per gratiam in homine, 
            vero Christus est excellentissime 
            quia in eo plenitudo deitatis inhabitat corporaliter.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q29-d1e4263">
            Secunda conclusio: 
            quod ubi Deus habitat ibi Deus est, 
            non tamen ubicumque est ibi habitat, 
            nam sicut anima tota simul <unclear>a?dem</unclear> 
            omnibus partibus corporis nec 
            est minor in minoribus, 
            tamen in aliis intensius in aliis remissius operatur, 
            ita Deus ubique est sed <unclear>in sanctis</unclear> 
            specialiter dicitur esse per gratiam 
            et in eis habitat sicut <unclear>in templo</unclear> 
            mali vero et si ibi sit ubi Deus qui nusquam deest, 
            non tamen sunt cum eo ideo dicitur 
            <quote xml:id="pg-b1q29-Qd1e941">Pater Noster qui est in caelis</quote>, 
            id est <unclear>in sanctis<!--?--></unclear> 
            in quibus est specialiori modo, 
            scilicet per gratiam, 
            non autem dicitur ubique.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q29-d1e4292">
            Tertia conclusio: 
            quod Deus antequam res essent 
            in se erat bene Deus in se est 
            et in rebus, 
            non enim sancti dicuntur domus Dei, 
            ita ut ipsa subtracta cadat Deus, 
            sed dicitur quod Deus in sanctis habitat, 
            ut si ipse discesserit cadant et deficiant.
          </p> 
          <p xml:id="pgb1q29-d1e4305">
            Quarta conclusio: 
            quod Deus est habitator quorumdam non cognoscentium Deum, 
            sicut parvulorum per 
            baptismum renatorum et habitator quorumdam cognoscentium Deum, 
            sicut beatorum Deum diligentium 
            quorumdam aut cognoscentium non est habitator, 
            sicut malorum qui eum 
            cognoscunt sed non diligunt, 
            illi enim ad templum Dei non pertinent 
            qui Deum cognoscentes non sicut Deum glorificant.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q29-d1e4319">
            Quinta conclusio: 
            sicut radii solis non contaminantur 
            sordibus ita divina essentia ubique existens nullis sordibus maculatur.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q29-d1e4325">
            Sexta conclusio: 
            quod omne corpus est locale 
            et <unclear cert="low">divisive</unclear> 
            in loco et mobile secundum locum 
            et secundum tempus spiritus vero creatus localis est, 
            sed non <unclear cert="low">divisive</unclear>, 
            sed determinative, nam 
            ita est hic quod non alibi invenitur et movetur secundum locum 
            et secundum tempus quoniam suscepit 
            vicissitudinem gaudii doloris scientiae et oblivionis, 
            Deus autem in localis est et incircumscriptabilis 
            ubique totus existens quia nec secundum tempus nec secundum locum movetur, 
            sed est omnino immobilis.
