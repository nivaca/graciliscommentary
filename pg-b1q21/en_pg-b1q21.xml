              And again because

              it follows that the Son and the Holy Spirit have the power of producing the Son.
              The consequent is false. 
              The consequence is clear

              there is a true likeness properly speaking. 
              This is clear through the conclusion. 
              It is confirmed because 
              where there is greater perfection, 
              equality and likeness 
              are truer and more proper. 
              But among the divine supposites 
              there is equality and likeness, 
              therefore it is most proper and most true.

              From this it seems to follows 
              in the first place that the equality and likeness 
              are not said in the divine only privatively, 
              but really and positively

              contingent or to conserve it in being.
              The first is clear because only the Father in the divine

              The first part is clear because the power of generating the Son

              and thus equality will still be int he divine properly speaking, 
              for though there are not three magnitudes, 
              nevertheless there are three great things adjectively taken.

              To the second, 
              it is said that equality and likeness are not absolutely an identity, 
              but there is an identity of the three persons.
              And when it is said that not 
              because the foundations of such things 
              are distinguished, this is denied.

              because the Father is not able to be grasped, etc
              He denies this 
              because, as he says, 
              the equality is not other than the identity. 
              But if the response were valid 
              the divine identity would be able to be said to be equal to itself. 
              Therefore I would say differently 
              that the antecedent is true 
              because it does not seem to be well thought 
              that the equality in the divine 
              is grasped unless two essences are received. 
              But it does not follows that the Father 
              is not able to be grasped as equal to the Son

              unless the essence is grasped twice by the intellect, 
              therefore the Father is not able to be equal to the Son
              unless the essence is taken twice 
              because it is the case that it is thus
